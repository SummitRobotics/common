# FRC Team 5468 Common Repository

This is a common Java library created by team Chaos Theory (5468, Summit High School)
to house robot code that gets recycled between years. The repository contains OI, drivetrain,
and utility code intended to be used within other projects as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).
The setup is heavily inspired by [team 2910's common repository](https://github.com/FRCTeam2910/Common).
